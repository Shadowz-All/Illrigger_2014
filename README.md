# MPMB MCDM Illrigger
This script adds the Illrigger & its subclasses from the MCDM *The Illrigger Revised*

**This script is compatible with v13.2.3 of the MPMB Character Sheet**  
 A separate script will be provided for the 2024 Ruleset to be be used with ThePokesimmer's 2024 scripts. 

This script was originally written by jaydee289 for *The Illrigger* by MCDM.  
It had later additions by Tedge after the *The Illrigger Revised* version was released.  
It has since been largely rewritten to fall in line with changes and updates to the Character Sheet.  

Credit goes to the MPMB community, because without anyone sharing any code, none of us would have a clue.
