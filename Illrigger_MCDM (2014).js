    descriptionFull: "You imbue a weapon you touch with an infernal blessing. Until the spell ends, the weapon extinguishes any mundane sources of light in a 30-foot radius. In addition, attacks made with the weapon deal an extra 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit. If the weapon isnt already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration. As a bonus action on your turn while holding this weapon, you can end the spell early and cause the weapon to emit a burst of dark energy. Each creature of your choice who you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isnt frightened. At the end of each of their turns, a frightened creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on themself on a success.",

The cloud of hellfire echoes with the cries of damned souls that can be heard by creatures within 30 feet of it. No light, even magical light, can illuminate the cloud, and any creatures fully within the area are blinded. The cloud warps the timescape, making the cloud's area difficult terrain. A creature that starts their turn in the area takes 3d6 fire damage. A creature that ends their turn in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 3d6 psychic damage as the voices of the damned crowd their mind.",

    descriptionFull: "You brandish the weapon used in the spells casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target  suffers the weapon attacks normal effects and then radiates a dark aura of energy until the start of your next turn. If the target makes an attack or casts a spell before then, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage and the spell ends. This spells damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for making an attack or casting a spell increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).",
